 <p>  How many times have you been working out?</p>
<p>When did you take your last medication?</p>

<p>So many things going on in your life that you might want to keep tabs on.</p>

<p>But the hassle in making a note of every activity is just too much.</p>

<p>trakit.me addresses the problem by allowing you to track any activity with one single click of a button.</p>

<p>You create a list of activities you want to track.</p>

<p>When it happens, you open log.me on your phone or computer and just hit the log button against that activity.</p>
<p>The activity and the day and time it happened is logged.</p>

<p>The idea is to make it as simple and fast as possible to log it.</p>

<p>Later, you can view your logs whenever you want to. It will always be there.</p><br>
